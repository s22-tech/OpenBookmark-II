OBM II


TO DO

• mobile layout is still pretty messed up

• loading.gif shows twice on screen - once in the main section and once in the folders section - why?

• $this->foreign_username appears to be empty in print_tree() in folders.php
	The folders menu shows the "user's Bookmarks" but once you navigate, it changes to "My Bookmarks" and the icons change color.

? the object orientation seems half-baked.  Some files are classes but others aren't.

• add password update in admin

• make each column scroll independently from each other.

√ added simplehtmldom to cover all cases of favicon paths.
