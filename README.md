# OpenBookmark-II
OBM II is a rewrite of Brendan LaMarche's fantastic OpenBookmark script, to bring it back to life and run on modern versions of PHP.  It retains the same 3-column layout, but has some major changes under the hood.  One of them is that favicons are now named with the domain name so that only a single favicon per domain is saved to your drive.  This will help keep your inode count low.  Besides, why save multiple icons when one will do?

More to come.
