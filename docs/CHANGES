- More code cleanup for PHP 8.3
- Changed favicon format to SVG as they are much smaller files.
- Favicons are named per domain now, so there won't be multiple icons saved for the same domain.  E.g.if you save a lot of YouTube videos, you don't need a separate icon for all of them.  Just one will do the trick.  Helps keep your inode count down.
